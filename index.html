        <h1>HISTORY OF REACT JS</h1>
        <div class="ex">
            <li>
                ReactJS is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was
                developed by Facebook and was first released in 2013. Since then, React has become one of the most
                widely
                used front-end development frameworks, with a large and active community of developers contributing to
                its
                growth and development.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                The history of ReactJS can be traced back to 2010 when Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook,
                created an internal prototype of React called "FaxJS." FaxJS was built to solve a specific problem that
                Facebook was facing at the time, which was to update the News Feed in real-time without having to
                refresh
                the page. FaxJS was successful in solving this problem, and Facebook soon realized that it had broader
                applications for building user interfaces.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                In 2011, Facebook started using React internally, and the library was later released as an open-source
                project in 2013 at the JSConf US conference. From there, React gained popularity quickly, and many
                developers started using it for building user interfaces. One of the key features that set React apart
                from
                other front-end frameworks was its ability to render changes in real-time, making it ideal for building
                dynamic web applications.
            </li> <br>

            <li>
                React's popularity continued to grow, and in 2015, Facebook released React Native, a framework for
                building native mobile applications using React. React Native uses the same principles and syntax as
                React,
                making it easy for developers to learn and use.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Today, React is widely used by companies and developers around the world, including Facebook,
                Instagram, Airbnb, and Netflix, among many others. The library has also evolved significantly since its
                initial release, with new features and improvements being added regularly.

        <h2>Reactjs</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            <p>
                React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
                for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
                community of individual developers and companies. <br><br>

                React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
                Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
                React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. <br><br> A
                key
                advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding
                unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
            </p>
            <h3>What is React??</h3>
            <p>
                React is a is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library created by Facebook in 2013. <br><br>
                React is used to build single-page applications. React is a tool for building UI components.<br><br>

        <h2> How does React Work?</h2>
        <div class="ex">

            React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory. <br>
            <br>
            You know the browser create DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all
            the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM. <br>
            <br>
            React only changes what needs to be changed! <br>
            <br>
            React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed. <br>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            <p>Download Nodejs.</p>
            <p>Set environment</p>
            <p>node -v</p>
            <p>npm -v</p>
            <p>Open cmd and run following commond:- npm install -g create-react-app</p>
            <p>Create a react app by following command :- npx create-react-app my-app</p>
            <p>
                cd my-app <br>

        <h2>ECMAScript 6 (ES6)</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            <p>
                ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was
                published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015. <br>
                <br>
                Why Should we Learn ES6? <br>
                React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like: <br>
                <br>
                (1) Classes <br>
                (2) Arrow Functions <br>
                (3) Variables (let, const, var) <br>
                (4) Array Methods like .map() <br>
                (5) Destructuring <br>
                (6) Modules <br>
                (7) Ternary Operator <br>
                (8) Spread Operator <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <div class="ex">
            <p>
                A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the
                keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1) How can i create a class?? <br>
                (2) How can i create a objects using the class??<br>
                (3) How can i create a method in the class??
            </p>
            <div class="ex">
                class Employee { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; constructor(name) { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; this.name = name; <br>

                employee1.work(); <br>
            </div>
            <h2>Class Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                &bull; To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword. <br><br>
                &bull; The super() method refers to the parent class. <br><br>
                &bull; A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:
            </p>
            <div class="ex">
                class Shap { <br>

        <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
