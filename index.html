        <h1>HISTORY OF REACT JS</h1>
        <div class="ex">
            <li>
                ReactJS is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was
                developed by Facebook and was first released in 2013. Since then, React has become one of the most
                widely
                used front-end development frameworks, with a large and active community of developers contributing to
                its
                growth and development.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                The history of ReactJS can be traced back to 2010 when Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook,
                created an internal prototype of React called "FaxJS." FaxJS was built to solve a specific problem that
                Facebook was facing at the time, which was to update the News Feed in real-time without having to
                refresh
                the page. FaxJS was successful in solving this problem, and Facebook soon realized that it had broader
                applications for building user interfaces.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                In 2011, Facebook started using React internally, and the library was later released as an open-source
                project in 2013 at the JSConf US conference. From there, React gained popularity quickly, and many
                developers started using it for building user interfaces. One of the key features that set React apart
                from
                other front-end frameworks was its ability to render changes in real-time, making it ideal for building
                dynamic web applications.
            </li> <br>

            <li>
                React's popularity continued to grow, and in 2015, Facebook released React Native, a framework for
                building native mobile applications using React. React Native uses the same principles and syntax as
                React,
                making it easy for developers to learn and use.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Today, React is widely used by companies and developers around the world, including Facebook,
                Instagram, Airbnb, and Netflix, among many others. The library has also evolved significantly since its
                initial release, with new features and improvements being added regularly.

        <div class="ex">
            <p>
                React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
                for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
                community of individual developers and companies. <br><br>

                React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
                Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
                React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. <br><br> A
                key
                advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding
                unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
            </p>
            <h3>What is React??</h3>

        <h2> How does React Work?</h2>
        <div class="ex">

            React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory. <br>
            <br>
            You know the browser create DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all
            the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM. <br>
            <br>
            React only changes what needs to be changed! <br>
            <br>
            React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed. <br>

        <h2>ECMAScript 6 (ES6)</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            <p>
                ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was
                published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015. <br>
                <br>
                Why Should we Learn ES6? <br>
                React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like: <br>
                <br>
                (1) Classes <br>
                (2) Arrow Functions <br>

            <p>
                &bull; To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword. <br><br>
                &bull; The super() method refers to the parent class. <br><br>
                &bull; A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:

                JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

                JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()
                and/or appendChild() methods.

                JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

        <h2>What is components in react??</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            <p>
                Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript
                functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, <br>
                (1) Class component <br>
                (2) Function component. <br> <br>

                <b>Class component :- </b> <br>
                React Class components have a built-in state object. You might have noticed that we used state earlier
                in the component constructor section. The state object is where you store property values that belongs
                to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders. <br>

                A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an
                inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

            </p>
            <h3>Example of class component :-</h3>
            <div class="ex">
                class Abc extends React.Component { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; render() { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, I am a class components!!!&lt;/h1&gt;; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; } <br>
                } <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <b>function component :- </b> <br>
            <div>
                React functional components are just normal JavaScript functions; we can create them using specific
                function keywords. Most developers create functional components using the Arrow function. The functional
                component's primary purpose is to render the view and the data to the browser.
            </div>
            <div class="ex">
                function Abc() { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, I am a function components!!!&lt;/h1&gt;; <br>
                } <br>

        <h2>React Class Components</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            <p>
                Before React 16.8, Class componentshas state and lifecycle on a React component.
                Function components were considered "state-less". <br>
                <br>
                By using hooks, Function components are equivalent to Class components. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Class component with constructor</h3>
            <p>
                The constructor() function will be called when the component gets initiated. <br>
                Properties are initiate in the constructor function. <br>
                In React, component properties should be kept in an object called state. <br>
            </p>
            <div class="ex">

                <b>State :- </b>
                React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that
                belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
                <br>
                <b>Changing the state Object :- </b> this.setState({name: "Vijay"});
                <br><br>
                <b>Props :- </b>
                props stands for properties.
                React components use props to communicate with each other.
                Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. <br>
                Props are arguments passed into React components.Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
                <br><br>
                <b>What are stateful components in React??</b> <br>
                <b>Stateful Components :-</b>

                They are capable of tracking changes, have knowledge of past, current, and potential future changes in
                themselves, and render their output accordingly. Stateful components are usually class components, but
                with the introduction of hooks, functional components can also maintain state. <br><br>
                <b>What are stateless components in React??</b> <br>
                <b>Stateless Components :-</b>
                A stateless component, also known as a functional component, is a fundamental concept in React that
                represents a UI element without any internal state management. In simpler terms, a stateless component
                is a function that takes in props as input and returns JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI.
            </p>
            <h3>Differences b/w <u>statefull and stateless</u> components??</h3>
            <p class="ex">
                What are Stateful Components? <br>
                Stateful components, also known as class components (traditionally), are those that manage their own
                state. In React, "state" refers to an object that determines how a component renders and behaves.
                Stateful components are responsible for keeping track of changing data that affects the render output of
                the component. <br>
                <br>
                Characteristics of Stateful Components: <br>
                <br>
                They can hold and manage local state. <br>
                They have lifecycle methods (like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.). <br>
                Usually more complex than stateless components. <br>
                Example Use Case: <br>
                A classic example is a form input. Let's consider a login form with email and password fields. The form
                component needs to track the values of these fields, handle changes, and potentially control form
                submission behavior. This state management necessitates the use of a stateful component. <br>
                <br>
                What are Stateless Components? <br>
                Stateless components, also referred to as functional components, do not hold or manage local state. They
                simply accept data via props and render UI elements. With the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8,
                functional components have become more powerful, allowing them to use state and other React features
                without being class-based. <br>
                <br>
                Characteristics of Stateless Components: <br>
                <br>
                Do not have their own state (although, with Hooks, this is less clear-cut). <br>
                They are usually simpler and used for presenting static UI elements. <br>
                Easier to test and maintain due to their simplicity. <br>
                Example Use Case: <br>
                A good example is a UI component like a button or a display label. These components receive all the data
                they need via props and render accordingly. For instance, a Button component might accept props like
                onClick, label, and style but does not manage any state internally. <br>
                <br>
                The Evolution with Hooks: <br>
                With the advent of Hooks, the line between stateful and stateless components has blurred. Functional
                components can now use useState, useEffect, and other hooks to manage state and side effects,
                traditionally the domain of class components. <br>
                <br>
                When to Use Each: <br>
                <br>
                Stateful Components: Use them when you need to manage state, lifecycle methods, or when dealing with
                complex UI logic that requires the component to keep track of changes over time. <br>
                <br>
                Stateless Components: Ideal for presentational components that focus solely on the UI and do not require
                any state management. They are more readable and easier to test. <br>
                <br>
                Conclusion <br>
                Understanding the difference between stateful and stateless components is pivotal in React development.
                While stateful components are essential for interactive elements that require data tracking, stateless
                components offer simplicity and efficiency for static UI elements. With the introduction of Hooks, React
                has provided more flexibility, allowing developers to use functional components in more complex
                scenarios. This distinction not only helps in organizing the codebase but also in optimizing the
                performance and maintainability of React applications. <br>

        <h2>Lifecycle of Components</h2>
        <p>
            Each component has a lifecycle method which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
            <br>

            (1). Mounting, <br>(2). Updating, <br> (3). Unmounting. <br>
            <img src="./image/lcm.jpg" alt="LCM">
        </p>
        <!-- ....................Mounting phase.................... -->
        <h2>Mounting</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            Mounting means putting elements into the DOM. <br><br>

            React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component: <br><br>

            (1). constructor() <br>
            (2). getDerivedStateFromProps() <br>
            (3). render() <br>
            (4). componentDidMount() <br><br>

            The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you
            define them.

            <h2>constructor</h2>
            <div class="ex">
                The constructor() method is called, when the component is initiated. <br>

                <!-- The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component). -->

        <h2>Updating</h2>
        <div class="ex">
            Whenever there is a change in a component's state or props so The component is updated <br>
            <br>
            React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated: <br>
            <br>
            (1). getDerivedStateFromProps() <br>
            (2). shouldComponentUpdate() <br>
            (3). render() <br>
            (4). getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() <br>
            (5). componentDidUpdate() <br><br>

            <div class="ex">
                <h2>getDerivedStateFromProps method()</h2>
                <p>
                    The getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. This is the first method that is called when a
                    component
                    gets updated. <br>
                    This is still the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props. <br>
                    In this example has a button, click it to change the state objrct, will update
                    getDerivedStateFromProps().
                </p>
                <h2>shouldComponentUpdate()</h2>
                <p>

                    In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React
                    should continue with the rendering or not. <br>
                    The default value is true. <br>
                    The example below shows what happens when the shouldComponentUpdate() method returns false: Not run

                </p>
                <h2>render()</h2>
                <p>
                    The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML
                    to the DOM, with the new changes.
                </p>

                <h2>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you have access to the props and state before the
                    update,
                    meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update.
                    <br> <br>
                    &bull; If the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is present, you should also include the
                    componentDidUpdate()
                    method, otherwise you will get an error.
                </p>
                <h2>componentDidUpdate()</h2>
                <p>
                    The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.
                    <br><br>
                    When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color "red".
                    <br><br>
                    When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and the color becomes "yellow".

        <h2>React Hooks </h2>
        <div class="ex">
            Hooks were added to React in version 16.8. <br>
            Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods. <br><br>

            Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class
            components are generally no longer needed. <br><br>

            Note : Although Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.
            <p class="border">
                <b>Hook Rules</b> <br>
                Hooks can only be called inside React function components. <br>
                Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component. <br>
                Hooks cannot be conditional

            <h3>UseMemo hooks</h3>
            <div class="ex">
                The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value. <br>

                Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated. <br>

                The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update. <br>

                This can improve performance. <br>

                The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized
                value and useCallback returns a memoized function. <br>

                <p class="border">

                    Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. Thus, it works equally well in
                    front-end JavaScript applications and back-end Node servers. <br>

                    This article shows how to use Axios in a simple React application. React is a JavaScript library for
                    building user interfaces, so we'll use Axios here for browser-based user interfaces. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Prerequisites</u></b> <br><br>
                    To follow along, you’ll need the following: <br> <br>

                    &bull; Node.js version 16.16.0 installed on your computer. <br>
                    &bull; A new React project set up with Create React App <br>
                    &bull; integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor of your choice, such as Sublime Text
                    or Visual Studio Code
                </p>
